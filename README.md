# Iconify plug-in for Sketch

Import MDI, FontAwesome, Jam, EmojiOne and many other icons to Sketch document. Over 30,000 icons to choose from.

See available icons on Iconify website: https://iconify.design/icon-sets/

## Why Iconify?

This plugin inserts SVG in Sketch document exactly same way as icons are shown on pages. Icons include extra layer that
matches viewBox, so you can resize and place icon correctly in your design and then in HTML document with same dimensions
it will look the same.

For designing you can use this plugin.

For coding you can use Iconify SVG framework or Iconify React component (components for other frameworks will be available later).

See https://iconify.design/

## Installation

Click ["Releases"](https://github.com/iconify-design/iconify-sketch/releases) link, download latest file, unpack it, open "iconify.sketchplugin" in Finder. Finder should launch Sketch that should install this plug-in.

If plug-in installation fails, copy iconify.sketchplugin to ~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins/

## Usage

In Sketch menu select Plug-ins -> Iconify
or press Ctrl+Shift+I

Browse or search icons, select any icon, click "Add" button. Plug-in will import icon to your current project.

## Known bugs

Icon might sometimes be imported outside of page. Drag it to correct location.

Plug-in will try to scale icon down to 16-24 pixels high. Some icons have weird huge dimensions, they might be imported with original SVG size instead of being scaled down. You need to scale down such icons yourself by selecting icon group and changing height.

## TODO

* [ ] Support dark theme
* [ ] Place SVG above/below currently selected layer
* [ ] Use selected layer's color instead of black for monotone icons
